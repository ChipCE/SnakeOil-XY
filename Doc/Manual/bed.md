# Aluminum bed plate

- The printer bed plate can be 190x190mm or 193x194mm to match the size of Prusa mini bed. The reason I choose the Prusa bed size is because PEI sheet for Prusa mini are easy to source and available in many type of surface.
- Compare to 190x190, 193x194mm bed have some extra space for bolts that we can used to align the PEI sheet on the bed.
